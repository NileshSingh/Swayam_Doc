A Section is the topmost category to organize the course. eg. Lectures conducted in Week 1 are labelled
as Section1 and those of Week 2 as Section 2 and so on, according to the need of the course. A section 
contains two or more Subsections. The author can decide on the number of Weeks or Sections. 

  .. image::  images/section.jpg

A Subsection is a sub-category of a Section. According to the course topics, the author can name the 
subsection. e.g. Subsection 1 can be termed as Lecture 1 and Subsection 2 as Lecture 2 and so on.

When the Course Creator sets out to create a new course, there are three options listed out - Contents, 
Settings and Tools. The following flowchart will guide the Course Creator in building the course.

  .. image::  images/course_creation.jpg
    :alt: course creation page

**Settings**

To create a new course in Swayam Studio, the first step is to schedule the course, invite students to 
attend the course and make information available to the Course Staff. To do this, you need to first choose 
the Settings option.

  .. image::  images/setting.jpg
    :alt: setting page

3.1. Schedule and Details 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

  **3.1.1.**Once the Settings option is clicked, you will now select Schedule and Details, in order to 
  schedule your course.

  **3.1.2.** You can invite students to register for the course by clicking on the highlighted option, 
  as seen in the image below.

  .. image::  images/basic_info.jpg
    :alt: basic info page

  **3.1.3.** To give the students adequate information about the Course Schedule, the Course Creator must share 
  details of when the course starts and ends. Again, the date and time when enrolment for the course will be open, 
  also clearly needs to be mentioned here. As shown in the image below, the Course Creator enters the relevant Course 
  Start and Course End details.

  .. image::  images/schedule_detail1.jpg
    :alt: schedule detail page

  * Course Start date: It is the date when the course starts.
  * Course End date: It is the date when the course ends.
  * Course Start time: It is the time at which the course is meant to start.
  * End Time: It is the time at which the course is meant to end.

  **3.1.4.** To introduce your Course, you can give a short description about the course in Course Short Description column.

  .. image::  images/course_intro.jpg
    :alt: Introducing your course

  This short description of the Course will look like the image below, on the students' side. 

  .. image::  images/course_lay.jpg
    :alt: course layout page

  **3.1.5.**  Edit the html code in the Course Overview column to specify details like, "About the course", 
  "description", "course staff information" and "prerequisites", to give an idea to the students about what 
  the course is going to teach and what the prerequisites for the student are, before they enrol for the course.

  .. image::  images/code_page.jpg
    :alt: code page

  **3.1.6.** There is a Course Image column that allows the Course Creator to upload an image for the course. 
  Depending on what is suited to the contents of the course, this image can be uploaded in the Course Image column.
  When you click on Upload Course Image, the image file to be uploaded can be selected from the directory.  

  .. image::  images/course_image.jpg
    :alt: code page

  .. image::  images/note2.jpg
    :alt: Note page

  **3.1.7.**  To give the students better insight into what the course has in store, the Course Creator 
  can upload a short Course Introduction Video, to attract more students to register for the course. 
  This then appears in the Course Summary page of the student's account.

  The video should include -

 * The instructor's details
 * The name of the university or institution introducing the video
 * The topics covered in this course
 * The benefits that students will gain after attending this course

  .. image::  images/course_video.jpg
    :alt: course video page

 * The video must first be uploaded in YouTube. Then the YouTube URL must be copied from the code after 
  `?v=' and before `&' and pasted in the above given textbox. 
 * e.g. If the YouTube id is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5a1dFlP_1I&list=UUeGHHdcfdJiDz8Jf5DZ-HaA   
  then you have to provide the URL " n5a1dFlP_1I 

  .. image::  images/note3.jpg
    :alt: Note page

  **3.1.8.** The Course Creator must also decide on how many hours a student needs to put in, on this course. 
  The estimated time hours per week can be entered here in `Hours of Effort per Week’. This will clearly state 
  the number of hours that a student is expected to work on this course.

  .. image::  images/course_creator1.jpg
    :alt: course creator page

3.2. Adding Course Team Members…
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  The Course Creator needs to decide who the other team members are, to work along in developing and 
  building the course. The team members may be Course Staff and Admin Access staff. While both the sets 
  of team members can access the entire course content, the Admin Access staff has the extra privilege of
  adding or deleting other Course Staff members. 

  **3.2.1.** Now, when the Course Creator decides to add such Course Team members, the Setting option needs 
  to be clicked again.

  .. image::  images/course_team.jpg
    :alt: course team link

  **3.2.2.** The Course Team is made of new team members. So, to add a new member to the course, click on 
  Add a New Team Member.

  .. image::  images/course_team1.jpg
    :alt: course team page

  **3.2.3.** Enter the email of the new team member and click on ADD USER.

  .. image::  images/course_team_add_user.jpg
    :alt: course team add user page

  **3.2.4.** When a Course Creator adds a new member to the team, the member must already have registered 
  an account with Swayam Studio. If the Course Creator feels the need to modify the Course Team, the option 
  to Remove Admin Access, Add Admin Access or Delete the Staff Member, by using the Delete icon, is available.

  .. image::  images/admin.jpg
    :alt: admin page

3.3. Grading…
+++++++++++++

  Before the course is uploaded and started, the grading policy needs to be defined by the Course Creator. 
  This helps the students to understand how their performances will be graded through the course.

  **3.3.1.** Clicking on the Settings column again, the Course Creator can select Grading at this step.

  .. image::  images/grading.jpg
    :alt: Grading link

  **3.3.2.** The first scale that will come on the screen by default, is an Overall Grade Range that broadly 
  classifies the students into Fail and Pass scale.

  .. image::  images/grading1.jpg
    :alt: Grading page

  **3.3.3.** If the Course Creator wants to modify this broad classification into a more specific scale, 
  this is what is to be done. Click on "+" symbol to increase the marks between the ranges or by dragging 
  the colours. eg. Grades can also be given by dragging at 85-100 as A grade, 70-85  as B grade, 55-70 as 
  C grade, 40-55 as D grade and below that as Fail.

  .. image::  images/overall_grading.jpg
    :alt: Grading page

  **3.3.4.** On the other hand, if the Course Creator is not satisfied with the set grades, then the grades 
  can be removed by using the option `remove'.

  .. image::  images/overall_grading_range.jpg
    :alt: Grading page

  **3.3.5.** The Course Creator can allow a Grace period to the students, though this is optional. Grace period is 
  an additional period allowed for the submission of assignment after the original submission time has elapsed. This 
  Grace Period is applicable to all the assignments in the course. If the Course Creator wants to modify this option,
  the Grace Period for the Course Assignment needs to be entered here, as shown, in Hours: Minutes format.

  .. image::  images/grading_rule.jpg
    :alt: Grading page

  **3.3.6.** To add some more interesting details on what kind of assignments the students can expect from 
  the course, the Course Creator must think of the Assignment Types to be included for the students in the 
  course. Assignment Types which are all graded will appear as `Assignment Type Name' in the form of quizzes,
  homework, lab work or a final examination. Here, the Course Creator must include details like Assignment Type 
  Name, Abbreviation, Total number of questions, Droppable, Weight of Total Grade, etc.

  .. image::  images/assignment.jpg

  **3.3.7.** Once the Assignment Type has been decided upon, the Course Creator must click on New Assignment 
  Type to add an assignment type or Delete to delete the existing Assignment Type.

3.4. Advanced Settings…
+++++++++++++++++++++++

This series of settings is not to be used when you are creating a course for the first time. In case there
are errors in creating the first course, the Course Creator will have to use Advanced Settings to change 
the manual key policy.We now move onto the next menu option, which is also not to be used in creating courses
for the first time – Tools.

  This includes all the important points that need to be remembered to create a course. For more details, 
  please refer to the Checklist. 

3.6. Export…
++++++++++++

This function is not to be used while creating content for the first time. Exporting data is an important 
step to save all the courses that have been created and their related content, in .tar.gz file format. This 
format will help the Course Creator and others import files, for further use.

3.7. Import A Course…
+++++++++++++++++++++

Importing a course is not to be used for first time course creation. When a course has already been created, 
the Course Creator may feel the need to upload some other material to supplement the existing course. Such 
content can be changed to suit the Course Creator's requirements once they are imported. 

  **3.7.1.** The Course Creator can include relevant course content, lectures or inputs from some other sources 
  in the format of .tar.gz files, by importing such content. This can be done by clicking on Tools and selecting Import.

  .. image::  images/import.jpg
    :alt: import page
  
  **3.7.2.** The Course Creator can import a course file by selecting` Choose a File to Import’. As shown in the image,
  the Course Creator needs to select a .tar.gz file to replace course content.

  **3.7.4.** After the file that is to be imported is selected, the Course Creator can click on 'Replace my course 
  with the one above'. This is a notification asking the Course Creator if the course content needs to be replaced. 
  If the Course Creator so decides, then it can be replaced with a click, as shown in the image below.

    :alt: import page

  **3.7.5.** Once the content has been imported, it will take a little time to show that the imported file has
  successfully replaced the existing course content, depending on its size.
